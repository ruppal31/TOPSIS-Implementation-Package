# TOPSIS-Implementation-Package
This project implements the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking alternatives based on multiple criteria.
✅ Project Objective
Select the best alternative among options based on multiple conflicting criteria using the TOPSIS algorithm.

🔢 Dataset
Sample dataset comparing laptops based on:

Price (₹)

RAM (GB)

Battery Life (hours)

Weight (kg)

Laptop	Price	RAM	Battery	Weight
A	50000	8	6	2.0
B	45000	4	5	2.2
C	55000	16	8	1.8
D	60000	8	10	1.9

📝 Methodology
Normalisation of decision matrix

Weighted normalisation based on criteria weights

Determine ideal best and worst values

Calculate separation measures (positive & negative)

Compute performance score for each alternative

Rank alternatives based on scores

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

pandas

numpy

Google Colab

📈 Results
✔ Ranked laptops based on their closeness to ideal solution, identifying the best option.
